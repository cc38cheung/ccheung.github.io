    <h1>Using Atom.io, GitHub.io, and Make it Live</h1>
    <h2>Using Atom.io</h2>
    <p> Go to <a href="https://atom.io/">atom.io</a> and click "Download Windows Installer"</p>
    <p> At the Welcome, on the right, go down to "Install a Package." Then click
       "Open Installer"</p>
      <div>Install the following:
      <ul>
        <li>atom-beautify</li>
        <li>pigments</li>
        <li>open-in browser</li>
        <li>autoclose-html</li>
        <li>linter-htmlhint</li>
        <li>linter-jshint</li>
        <li>linter-csslint</li>
        <li>atom-bootstrap3</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
    <p>Now, go to "Themes".</p>
    <div>Install the following:
    <ul>
      <li>monoki</li>
      <li>seti</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
    <h2>Using GitHub</h2>
    <p>Go to its site at github.com and create a new account</p>
    <p>
      Now, create a repository name. This name can be anything, however
      instead of using .come or any other form for others to recognize you,
      you must have <a href="http://.github.io">github.io</a>. For example: cc38cheung.github.io Fill
      in your Google GMail and a password you can remember. Continue following
    their steps.</p>
    <p>
      Now, go back to <a href="https://atom.io">atom</a> and create a basic
      webpage.  Inside the 'body',type in something so that you are sure there
      is something to see on the webpage. Usually, people will type in "Hello
      World!" Then, using your  computer mouse, right click and look down to
      find "Show in Explorer".</p>
    <p>
      This next step is to be sure there is a link between your website and on
      your GitHub. That way, poeple will be able to see your sites, and when you
      last updated a site. To do this, go to an online site like Google and type
      in GitHub desktop. On the right, click "Download GitHub Desktop". When it
      finishes downloading, ONLY use "GitHub" on your desktop; the other called
      "GitShell" will not do anything and is only a code.
    </p>
    <p>
      On GitHub (from your desktop), you will be able to find three tabs saying:
      "Add", "Create", and "Clone". Click on "Create" and type in your
      repository name. Afterwards, locate your GitHub file from your computer.
      Once that is done, you can go back to your site from
      <a href="https://atoms.io">atoms</a> and save your file in the GitHub.
      From the example above, it would be a "cc38cheung.github.io" file.
      That would be where you save your file. Name your webpage anything you
      want, but be sure at the end to save it as ".html". Going back to GitHub
      Desktop, click on the third tab, "Clone" and type in your repository. This
      combines both your own webpage as well as on GitHub.</p>
      <p>
        On the bottom in GitHub, fill in the first typebox that says "Summary".
        Then, click "Commit to Master".
        On the right in GitHub, click on "Sync" to bring your website to
        GitHub.com for others to see your web design work!
